# About The Project
ZenBot is an automatic trading algorithm written under Python + MetaTrader5 library.

This trading algorithm uses statistical analysis with over 20 years of historical data and machine learning models to identify each trade's entry type (i.e., long, shot). Moreover, the main strategy for this algorithm was built using the reversal trading method combined with marketing psychology. Also, this algorithm only trades on the EURUSD forex pair due to its liquidity and popularity.
